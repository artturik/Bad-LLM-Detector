# Bad LLM Detector

Chrome extension that helps you identify AI generated texts while browsing the web. It highlights words frequently used by large language models (LLMs) to give you quick (but not perfect) clues that the content might be AI generated.

The extension uses a customizable list of words, originally sourced from [FareedKhan-dev/Detect-AI-text-Easily](https://github.com/FareedKhan-dev/Detect-AI-text-Easily).

> **Disclaimer**: Detection is not accurate! The name "BAD" in "Bad LLM Detector" reflects a LOTS of false-positive and false-negative results.

Use this extension as a fun and quick way to identify potential AI-written content, but always verify content sources manually.
